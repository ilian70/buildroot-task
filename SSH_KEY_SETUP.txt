SSH PUBLIC KEY REGISTRATION FOR BUILDROOT IMAGE
================================================

Your SSH public key has been registered in the buildroot image.

DETAILS:
--------
Key ID: ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIAzbpqmTXzWcBpCoffFLGE/GIJJmVz7m3NWdWyeEeGRn (ilian@ubuntu-git)

FILES MODIFIED:
1. Created: /home/innocore/Projects/br-task/post-build.sh
   - This script creates ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the target system
   - Adds your public key to the root user's authorized_keys
   - Sets proper permissions (700 for .ssh, 600 for authorized_keys)

2. Updated: /home/innocore/Projects/buildroot/.config
   - Modified BR2_ROOTFS_POST_BUILD_SCRIPT to include the new post-build.sh script
   - Now runs both the RPi5 post-build script and the SSH key setup script

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Rebuild the image with: make -C /home/innocore/Projects/buildroot
2. Once built, the image will have your SSH key in root's authorized_keys
3. You can then SSH to your device as root without a password:
   ssh root@<device-ip>

NOTES:
------
- The key is registered for the root user only
- If you need the key for other users, update post-build.sh accordingly
- Make sure SSH server is enabled (it is by default in your config)
- The device will accept your SSH key only when using port 22 (default)
